Q. What is react?
A. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Q. What are the major features of React?
A. The major features of React are:
    Uses JSX syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code.
    It uses VirtualDOM instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
    Supports server-side rendering.
    Follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding.
    Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.

Q. What are the disadvantages of React?
A. High pace of development
   Poor documentation i.e., documentation is not upto date.
   Not a full featured framework 
   Sometimes JSX acts as a barrier
   
Q. What is JSX?
A. It stands for Javascript XML.
   Allows us to write HTML inside Javascript and place them in the DOM without using functions like appendChild() or createElement().

Q. Can web browsers read JSX directly?
A. -Web browsers cannot read JSX directly. This is because they are only read regular JS objects and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object.
   -For the browser to read a JSX file, the file needs to be transformed into a regular JavaScript object. For this, we use Babel.
   
Q. What is the virtual DOM?
A. DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM represents an HTML document with a logical tree struture. 
   Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains object.
   React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM.
   When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM, rather than updating all the objects.
